# VEXCode-Recorder-Replay

These programs are designed to record and replay driver movement for VEX IQ robots. 
There are programs for generation 1 and generation 2 brains.
The generation 2 programs have more features making it easier to use. 
The generation 2 programs have interfaces on the brain that you can interact with using the buttons E Up, E Down, F Up, and F Down on the controller. 
The generation 2 programs allow for saving the recording to a micro SD card in the brain. This feature isn't in thegeneration 1 brains.
The programs are setup already to fit our current robot.
